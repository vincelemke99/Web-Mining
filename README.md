# Recommendation Systems on the X-Wines dataset
This project was created as part of the Web Mining Project of the University of Mannheim, course on Web Mining (FSS 2025).
Multiple recommender systems and architectures are developed and evaluted on the X-Wines dataset by de Azambuj et al. (2023) available under: https://github.com/rogerioxavier/X-Wines.

## Introduction

## Methodology

### Testset split

There are some deviations on average between the different distributions
Wasserstein Distance between train and hot_user_hot_item: **0.148**<br>
Wasserstein Distance between train and hot_user_cold_item: 0.062<br>
Wasserstein Distance between train and cold_user_hot_item: 0.044<br>
Wasserstein Distance between train and cold_user_cold_item: **0.181**
